Thanks for considering contributing to Yags!

## A few rules of thumb:

1. Code contributions should match the existing code style. Run npm run lint to check, and npm run format to fix some problems.
2. Discuss additions/changes with us on GitHub Issues before working on them
3. Check the dev branch to make sure someone hasn't worked on the same thing already
4. Pull requests should point to the dev branch, not master
